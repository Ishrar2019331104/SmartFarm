# smart_farm

SmartFarm is an IoT based smart agriculture monitoring and automatic irrigation system developed using ESP8266 NodeMCU and Firebase Realtime Database. Features include monitoring soil moisture, air temperature and relative humidity of air, and remotely controlling irrigation. 

To monitor soil relative humidity, air temperature and relative humidity of air, we have made a mobile application using Flutter as a framework. 
The project was made by me and Rabbani2019331039 for our PROJECT 250 course during our undergrad 2nd year.

## Application Features

- Real-time monitoring of:
  - Soil moisture
  - Air temperature
  - Humidit
- Visual display of circular indicators
- Automatic updates through Firebase listeners
- Remote control of water pump
- Pop-up notifications for pump state

## Tech Stack

- User interface: Flutter
- Firebase Realtime Database (IoT data sync)
