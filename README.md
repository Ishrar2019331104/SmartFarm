# smart_farm

In this project, we made an IoT based smart agriculture monitoring and automatic irrigation system using ESP8266 NodeMCU. To monitor soil relative humidity, air temperature and relative humidity of air, we have made a mobile application using Flutter as a framework. 
The project was made by me and Rabbani2019331039 for our PROJECT 250 course during our undergrad 2nd year.
